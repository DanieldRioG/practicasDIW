                        Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food.
                        Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of
                        fuel.

                        Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make
                        a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.

                        Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help
                        track your activity level and calories.

                        Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a
                        week.

                        Use the following as a guideline:

                        Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat
                        Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas
                        Fruit
                        Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds
                        Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high
                        in carbohydrates.

                        When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on
                        fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.
